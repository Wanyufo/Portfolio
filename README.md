__Welcome traveller!__
You have successfully found your way into the Showroom of my Workshop.

I dabble in the craft 3-dimensional illusion magic and here you will find a selection of my works, old and new, and sometimes even some works in progress.

 Here are some of my earlier works (both pages include videos of the Application):
 * [Pre-Bachelors Project school website](https://web0.fhnw.ch/ht/informatik/ip5/22fs/22fs_iit04/index.html)
 * [Bachelors Project school website](https://web0.fhnw.ch/ht/informatik/ip6/22hs/22hs_iit06/index.html)
  
A glimpse of my current work as a research assistant can be found here:
* WIP; video has yet to be made, check back soon to see it

  
Recently, i have started a small private project with an artist friend of mine:
* [KNOBBLY](https://github.com/Wanyufo/KNOBBEL), a WIP game where a small mouse works with a little girl to hunts bugs
